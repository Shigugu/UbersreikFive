The Vermintide Mod Framework (VMF) is an open-source, community-run framework of modules that provides enhanced modding capabilities and support. The framework is designed to be both independent and lightweight; making no changes to gameplay on its own.

Mods created for the project may utilize:
[list]
    [*]Mod options
    [*]Shared function hooks
    [*]Chat commands
    [*]Keybinds
    [*]Mutator support (only available in Vermintide 1 at this time)
    [*]Network calls
    [*]Rewritten, lightweight mod functions
    [*]An on-event call system
[/list]

The Vermintide Mod Framework originally started in Warhammer End Times: Vermintide as an unofficial modding platform. In the time since, VMF has been rewritten and redesigned with contributions from many unique members of the community; culminating in this unified project made for the arrival of official mod support.

If you're interested in creating mods with VMF, please check out [url=https://vmf-docs.verminti.de/]the project's wiki[/url].

If you'd like to contribute to the code behind VMF, visit [url=https://github.com/Vermintide-Mod-Framework/Vermintide-Mod-Framework]the project's GitHub repository[/url]. (string)

This also works when lighting candles and pushing bricks in certain levels. Check the options for customizations.

Docs:
http://stevedonovan.github.io/Penlight/api/index.html

Use:
local pl = require'pl.import_into'()
pl.tablex.deepcompare(t1, t2)

Or to require individual modules:
local tablex = require'pl.tablex'
tablex.deepcompare(t1, t2)

Please DO NOT use require 'pl', this pollutes the global table.

Some modules have been removed due to security concerns: sip and lapp, and those related to file access.
Note that using the pretty module to print tables can cause a stack overflow due to it not handling recursion in table members.

16:55:28.839 [Lua]   [description] = [b]Allows you to save multiple configurations of equipment and talents for each hero career, so that you can restore an entire configuration with a couple of mouse clicks.[/b]

Some things that might not be obvious:
[list]
[*] You can right-click on a loadout number to restore that loadout without having to open the loadout details panel.
[*] You can rename a loadout by clicking on its current name at the top of the loadout details panel.
[*] Loadouts are saved to a Steam cloud file, so if you play Vermintide 2 on multiple PCs using the same account, your loadouts should be automatically kept up to date on all of them without having to manually copy files.
[/list]

Version: 1.1.0
Changelist:
1.1.1: Fix for breakage caused by patch 1.5 of the game.
1.1.0: Added a few new features: bot override loadouts, right-click loadout number to restore it, and restore loadouts on hero-select screen when joining games.
1.0.6: Fix for another exploit which allowed items to be equipped in the wrong slots.
1.0.5: Fix for exploits which allowed items to be equipped on the wrong careers.
1.0.4: Don't rely on deprecated behaviour of hook library (repeatedly hooking same function).
1.0.3: Fix for breakage from changes in v1.2 of the game.
1.0.2: Fixes to work with hero/career switch in UI Improvements mod
1.0.1: Fixes for UI scaling
1.0.0: Initial release

The mod currently features 3 modifications :

[b]1 - Better Melee Choices:[/b] The bots will now favor normal attacks over charged much more, unless their target would not be damaged by normal attacks.

[b]2 - Stay Closer:[/b] Whenever enemies are nearby, the bots will stay much closer to human players, making them more reliable during hordes.

[b]3 - Ping Elites:[/b] The bots will ping any elites that attack them, within the same limits of what a player could do. This will trigger appropriate voicelines and Witch-Hunt buffs.

Each of these features can be independantly toggled on and off in the mod options. (string)

Now, your opponents actually possess a will to live, and all wish for your death.

If you truly believe yourself a legend, you will crush their dreams.[/i]

-------

Deathwish is a mod that empowers all enemies way past the pitiful strength they have on legend, while making sure the challenge remains enjoyable. Skaven will regain the resilience they once possessed in the first Vermintide, and the northlanders will show their true strength.

This mod is based around and replaces legend difficulty when enabled, but one can also select champion instead to experience it with less intense spawn rates (but just as strong enemies).

The full list of all changes made compared to vanilla legend would be too much clutter to include, but here's a shortened version :

* Increased health of all common infantry by ~125%.
* Increased health of all elites and specials by ~80%.
* Increased health of bosses by 50%.
* Increased mass and stagger resistance of all enemies by ~100%. Further increased the mass and stagger resistance of slave rats and fanatics to bring them closer to (but still below) that of clan rats.
* Increased the damage of common infantry by ~25-33%.
* Increased the damage of elites, specials and bosses by ~50%.

While these changes might seem very heavy-handed at first sight, that is because this shortened list does not do them justice. All the values modified were modified by hand, one at a time, with thought put into making health breakpoints fair and enjoyable yet challenging, while also staying true to the design and feel of the vanilla game.

Use [b]/deathwish[/b] in the chat to toggle. Must be hosting and in the keep. Due to an issue found with mass, clients [b]do[/b] need to be subscribed for everything to work as expected. They however do not need to do anything beyond subscribing and enabling the mod in the mod manager. (string)

So you've killed a few thousand. Try millions, then maybe we'll talk.

Maybe.[/i]

-------------------

Onslaught is a difficulty mod that, as its name would suggest, increases spawn rates of all enemies significantly.

However, this increase is nothing like a 'send in the next wave' or 'vanguard' deed. It features extensive changes to the very compositions of what the AI director throws at you, making hordes capable of throwing a mixture of elites at you, as well as making ambient packs much more threatening.

Furthermore, Onslaught features a redesign of [i]every single event in the game[/i] to make each of them unique challenges, and the highlights of the map.

16:55:28.841 [Lua]   [description] = Press spacebar at the start of the mission to skip the cutscene you've seen a hundred of times before. Only works if all players have this mod installed.

Aussiemon's original Skip Cutscenes mod was denied sanctioning because it affects other players who do not have the mod and "ruins their anticipation at the start of the map to have a bunch of other players running around derping during the cutscene".

This mod aims to solve that problem by only allowing you to skip the cutscene if all players in your team are using this mod, thus making it sanctionable.

Obviously based off of the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1391114686]original mod[/url] with permission.

16:55:28.842 [Lua]   [description] = This mod lets hosting players spawn enemy and ambient units, both in missions and the keep.

Enemies in the keep will spawn at the last-selected difficulty level. Start a level at the difficulty level you want to test, then return to the keep.

To start using the mod, open the Vermintide Mod Framework's options menu (default key: F4), and set keybinds for the various features.

Added commands are:
[list]
[*] [b]/save_unit <1-3>[/b]
[*] [b]/selected_units[/b]
[/list]

Creature Spawner is currently in development, so expect some instability.
