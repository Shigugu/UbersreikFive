The Vermintide Mod Framework (VMF) is an open-source, community-run framework of modules that provides enhanced modding capabilities and support. The framework is designed to be both independent and lightweight; making no changes to gameplay on its own.

Mods created for the project may utilize:
[list]
    [*]Mod options
    [*]Shared function hooks
    [*]Chat commands
    [*]Keybinds
    [*]Mutator support (only available in Vermintide 1 at this time)
    [*]Network calls
    [*]Rewritten, lightweight mod functions
    [*]An on-event call system
[/list]

The Vermintide Mod Framework originally started in Warhammer End Times: Vermintide as an unofficial modding platform. In the time since, VMF has been rewritten and redesigned with contributions from many unique members of the community; culminating in this unified project made for the arrival of official mod support.

If you're interested in creating mods with VMF, please check out [url=https://vmf-docs.verminti.de/]the project's wiki[/url].

If you'd like to contribute to the code behind VMF, visit [url=https://github.com/Vermintide-Mod-Framework/Vermintide-Mod-Framework]the project's GitHub repository[/url]. (string)

Docs:
http://stevedonovan.github.io/Penlight/api/index.html

Use:
local pl = require'pl.import_into'()
pl.tablex.deepcompare(t1, t2)

Or to require individual modules:
local tablex = require'pl.tablex'
tablex.deepcompare(t1, t2)

Please DO NOT use require 'pl', this pollutes the global table.

Some modules have been removed due to security concerns: sip and lapp, and those related to file access.
Note that using the pretty module to print tables can cause a stack overflow due to it not handling recursion in table members.

The successor to Bestiary and Armory, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/itemedittext/?id=1653236575]Vermitannica[/url], has arrived! Soon, all the features found in Armory will be present in Vermitannica.
As such, support for Armory & Bestiary is being discontinued. Download Vermitannica now and offer your feedback!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Updated for 1.4 (Back to Ubersreik)!
- Note: Bardin's Dual Hammers "Light Attack 4" is actually the followup attack after the push attack.
This will be fixed to be more intuitive in a future update.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Armory provides an in-game weapon browser, complete with:

               - Basic weapon attributes;
               - Model & illusion previews;
               - In-depth attack attributes & bonuses (coming soon)

               Open with /armory or set a keybind using the Mod Options menu (F4 by default) (string)

In vanilla crosshairs are a static size on your screen not accounting for your custom FOV. They also don't account for some other math related to 2d projection of a 3d space (i.e. your monitor).
As you can see from the images this mod makes it so the crosshairs show the same (and correct) amount of spread regardless of your set FOV. (Example images are 120 and 45)

Warning: Very likely incompatible with other crosshair mods. Willing to work on compatability however.

https://github.com/Skwuruhl/vermintide-2-crosshair-fix

More in depth explanation: What vanilla specifically does is assume that 15Ã‚Â° of spread is equal to 228 pixels of spread on a 1080p monitor. This ignores that the pixels of spread will change depending on your field of view.

It also assumes that 5Ã‚Â° of spread will be equal to 228/3 pixels of spread. This ignores that degrees and pixels aren't a linear relation since it's a 3d space being projected to a 2d image.

Mod makes crosshairs scale using the tangent function as 1080 * tan(spread/2)/tan(fov/2) to get a radius to place the crosshairs away from the center of the screen. Math is similar to my customizable sensitivity mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1498189723 (string)

=======================================================================
The option to host private quick play games had to be removed for the mod to get sanctioned.
=======================================================================

Allows you to host a quick play session even if you are playing solo. Other players might still join your lobby.

type [b]/host_toggle[/b] to toggle on and off.

[h1] Update [/h1]
- Added option to use a hotkey to toggle the mod on and off.
- You can now host the weekly challenges with this mod.

[h1] Important [/h1]
As the purpose of the quick play function is to fill open lobbies you will have to actively enable the solo-host-function by typing '/host_toggle' [b] every time you start up [/b] your game (game != lobby).

Despair no more!

This mod shows the country code in front of the host's name, so you'll always know whether you should get a good ping or not before joining.

Does not affect quickplay unfortunately - the matchmaking code is a black box managed by Steam with only the dumb and often ineffective distance filters already in use.

You can also filter the lobby list by typing "/country UK" (for example) in the chat.

[*]Show your currently applied hero skin and headgear on the hero visible in start menu and hero selection menu.
[*]Apply your weapon skin to the hero in both menus IF your currently selected weapon for that hero matches one used in the preview (eg halberd on mercenary, spear on handmaiden, etc).
[/list]

[b]What this mod [u]WILL NOT[/u] do:[/b]
[list]
[*]Apply any non-equipped or not obtained skins to the hero and weapon in both menus.
[*]Give you an option to select separate customization for heroes in both menus.
[*]Apply weapon skin IF your currently selected weapon for the class is not of the same type as the one in preview (eg halberd on mercenary, spear on handmaiden, etc).
[/list]

[i]Additionally, there is an option to enable classic Vermintide 1 class selection animations for Mercenary, Ironbreaker, Waywatcher, Witch Hunter Captain, Pyromancer and Bright Wizard.[/i]

[h1]New feature - Hero share screen![/h1]
While in keep, now you can access a hero share screen via [i]/sharemyhero[/i] chat command!
What is more, you can specify up to three animation events that will be played on your character in that menu separated via space, eg: [i]/sharemyhero select_hover_loop face_happy dialogue_talk[/i]. Animation list can be found [url=https://pastebin.com/YM2FYhBN]HERE(CLICK)[/url].

On top of that, you can choose from 9 different background item sets for the share menu (available in mod options menu).

Last but not least, you can press F5 key to dump high quality .DDS screenshot of the share menu to your game installation folder. (string)

[b]2 - Stay Closer:[/b] Whenever enemies are nearby, the bots will stay much closer to human players, making them more reliable during hordes.

[b]3 - Ping Elites:[/b] The bots will ping any elites that attack them, within the same limits of what a player could do. This will trigger appropriate voicelines and Witch-Hunt buffs.

Each of these features can be independantly toggled on and off in the mod options. (string)

10:07:09.088 [Lua]   [description] = Adds settings to either scale by zoom ratio or by monitor distance.

Zoom ratio scaling unsuprisingly scales sensitivity by the zoom ratio or focal length. This is desirable because if an object appears 2x as large while zoomed in then sensitivity will be scaled by 2x. Example album: https://imgur.com/a/4B1FaVI
Coefficient for this mode is simply a multiplier such that 70% is a 0.7x multiplier to zoom sensitivity.
If you use 0 UsA or monitor distance in Battlefield or CoD then use this mode and as the coefficient use your ADS sensitivity multiplier (for most people 100%).
To match CS:GO using this mode go [url=https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=x+%3D+1.0+;+x*4%2F9%2F(tan(40*pi%2F360)%2Ftan(90*pi%2F360))]here[/url] and set x to your zoom sensitivity multiplier. Set this to your coefficient. e.g. if wolfram gives me 1.2211 I use a 122.11% coefficient.

Monitor distance works like Uniform Soldier Aiming from Battlefield or the new Relative ADS sensitivity in Black Ops 4. Basically what it does is use the ratios of FOV of an arbitrary aspect ratio as a sensitivity multiplier. A higher value results in higher sensitivity while a lower value approaches zoom ratio scaling.
Coefficient for this mode works such that 100% is ratio of vertical FOV (the game's default scaling method), 177.78% is ratio of 16:9 horizontal fov, 133.33% is ratio of 4:3 horizontal fov.
To match Battlefield or CoD just use your UsA or monitor distance value from those games. Except if you use 0, then switch to zoom ratio with a 100% coefficient.
To match with this mode CS:GO's default use 133.33%


I personally recommend leaving it to scale by zoom ratio with a 100% coefficient.

Note: If you change your FOV, then the sensitivity won't properly adjust until you go through a load screen or restart the game.

[*] Loadouts are saved to a Steam cloud file, so if you play Vermintide 2 on multiple PCs using the same account, your loadouts should be automatically kept up to date on all of them without having to manually copy files.

10:07:09.088 [Lua]   [description] = [h1][b]This mod adds a reimagined version of early scrapped mechanic of combat stances[/b][/h1]

Stances are self-cast 60 second buff on a base 240 second cooldown which give the player an ability to enhance his offensive or defensive capabilities. Stance can be cancelled at any time, decreasing the cooldown by remainder of stance buff timer. Once stance has been cancelled or expired, player receives a "tired" cooldown debuff which by default lasts up to 40 seconds.

Mod adds an UI widget below ammo counter which shows current charge percentage of stance change (size and position of the widget is fully customizable in mod settings). Widget opacity and percentage color changes as recovery percentage increases - once it reaches 100% (which is accompanied by a sound event) player is able to perform next stance change.

[b]Stances:[/b]

[list]
[*]Outside the Keep ALL natural light sources (sun, sky, ambient lighting) are disabled completely.
[*]Upon spawning all human players are equipped with a torch (LMB-Attack, RMB-Block, Scroll Press-Throw away).
[*]Pinging is disabled.
[*]On Champion and Legend difficulty HUD will also be disabled entirely unless you're carrying a torch.
[*]Vignette will change opacity and color as your health drops.
[*]Sienna will always be able to see her overheat meter.
[*]Witch Hunter Captain is able to apply passive ping damage increase debuff when carrying torch (outline will be invisible).
[*]Bardin and Kerilian see [i]slightly better[/i] even without the torch (effect depends on map).
[/list]

[b]Notes:[/b]
[list]
[*][i]All participating players should have the mod installing for best experience.[/i]
[*]Torch can be passed between players with right mouse click (when targeting an ally without torch).
[*]Bots can carry torch for you if you give it to them (they will also defend themselves with it.
[*]Bots will drop the torch if their health drops below 35%
[*]Bots can be forced to drop their torches via [i]/pdbotdroptorch[/i] chat command (available only to host!).

Now, your opponents actually possess a will to live, and all wish for your death.

If you truly believe yourself a legend, you will crush their dreams.[/i]

-------

Deathwish is a mod that empowers all enemies way past the pitiful strength they have on legend, while making sure the challenge remains enjoyable. Skaven will regain the resilience they once possessed in the first Vermintide, and the northlanders will show their true strength.

This mod is based around and replaces legend difficulty when enabled, but one can also select champion instead to experience it with less intense spawn rates (but just as strong enemies).

The full list of all changes made compared to vanilla legend would be too much clutter to include, but here's a shortened version :

* Increased health of all common infantry by ~125%.
* Increased health of all elites and specials by ~80%.
* Increased health of bosses by 50%.
* Increased mass and stagger resistance of all enemies by ~100%. Further increased the mass and stagger resistance of slave rats and fanatics to bring them closer to (but still below) that of clan rats.
* Increased the damage of common infantry by ~25-33%.
* Increased the damage of elites, specials and bosses by ~50%.

While these changes might seem very heavy-handed at first sight, that is because this shortened list does not do them justice. All the values modified were modified by hand, one at a time, with thought put into making health breakpoints fair and enjoyable yet challenging, while also staying true to the design and feel of the vanilla game.

Use [b]/deathwish[/b] in the chat to toggle. Must be hosting and in the keep. Due to an issue found with mass, clients [b]do[/b] need to be subscribed for everything to work as expected. They however do not need to do anything beyond subscribing and enabling the mod in the mod manager. (string)

10:07:09.089 [Lua]   [description] = This mod lets hosting players spawn enemy and ambient units, both in missions and the keep.

Enemies in the keep will spawn at the last-selected difficulty level. Start a level at the difficulty level you want to test, then return to the keep.

To start using the mod, open the Vermintide Mod Framework's options menu (default key: F4), and set keybinds for the various features.

Added commands are:
[list]
[*] [b]/save_unit <1-3>[/b]
[*] [b]/selected_units[/b]
[/list]

Creature Spawner is currently in development, so expect some instability.

10:07:09.089 [Lua]   [description] = MorePlayers lets you play the game with 8 players.
All the players need this mod to make it work.

Chat commands on hero selection:
- /set_profile_id <profile_id> - Switch profile spot
- /set_character <profile_id> <character_id> - Change character on profile spot
- /set_career_id <career_id> - Switch different career on the profile you are playing

How to use the mod:
- Install the mod and host your game.
- All your friends also need to install the mod. The first 5 players dont need to use any commands to connect to the server. 
- The 6e, 7e and 8e friend need to go the 'hero selection' and type in '/set_profile_id 6' or '/set_profile_id 7' or '/set_profile_id 8' to claim the profile.
After they are switched to a different profile they can connect to your server.

Very important:
-If the 6e, 7e and 8e player are done with the game. Switch back to '/set_profile_id 1'.
 If they don't do this your account stay corrupted and the official game will crash.
- Dont use the chat commands if you dont know what you are doing. This can break your account without knowing what your doing.

Options:
- When using this mod you can still join servers that doesn't have this mod installed.

Important:
- Don't enable 'Duplicated Character' mod. This project is outdated and has been migrated in MorePlayers mod.

Last note:
Please post your console log when you crash:
C:\Users\IamLupo\AppData\Roaming\Fatshark\Vermintide 2\console_logs
And save it on here: https://pastebin.com/

10:07:09.089 [Lua]   [description] = Fix for all the weapon switching foibles.

Some disclosure:
This does bring back the Bounty Hunter swap to melee abuse, but this is actually fixable by checking if a melee weapon dealt the killing blow, not the equipped weapon. It also introduces some animation cancelling for faster attacks, this could be fixed by allowing you to do q->q quicly, but introducing a cooldown q->q->cooldown->q. These are things you'd have to consciously abuse, so I'm not bothered about it on the mod realm.
But all this means the mod isn't getting sanctioned in its current state. I want to see how receptive Fatshark is to bugfix mods first before spending time making any of the changes above. And this really is something Fatshark should fix themselves, it's a pretty big deal gameplay-wise.

Added rudimentary support for saving SpawnTweaks mod settings into presets. To save your settings into a new true_solo preset:
/st_save_preset true_solo
/st_load_preset true_solo
To delete the preset:
/st_delete_preset true_solo

Changes since last version:
- option for patrols to aggro on spawn
- enable all map boss triggers to be only patrols or only bosses or both
- hordes come from both directions(doesn't work with blob horde type, I suggest you use the option to disable blob hordes)

[h1] Mod Features [/h1]

Vermintide Reloaded is a complete overhaul for the base game's ranged weapon system. This mod gives all ranged weapons in the game infinite ammo as well as making them more powerful for some fast-paced gameplay. Overheat weapons have been given bonus attack speed on high overheat and additional combat effects to make them equally competitive. 
To enhance the challenge, this mod also comes with optional spawn tweaks to increase the difficulty of the game by increasing horde, special and boss spawn rates. These can be enabled or disabled in the mod options. 

The goal of the mod is to create a brand new and less hardcore gamemode focused around ranged combat. Each weapon is individually balanced to give them a unique strengths and weaknesses in combat and play very differently contrasted with their vanilla counterparts. It's compatible with most spawn tweaking mods if you find the game too easy.

*** If you run into any crashes list the weapon you were using as well as your mod list.
