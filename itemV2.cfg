Chat commands on hero selection:

How to use the mod:
- Install the mod and host your game.
- All your friends also need to install the mod. The first 5 players don't need to use any commands to connect to the server. 
- The 6e, 7e and 8e friend need to go the 'hero selection' and type in '/set_profile 6' or '/set_profile 7' or '/set_profile 8' to claim the profile.
After they are switched to a different profile they can connect to your server.
