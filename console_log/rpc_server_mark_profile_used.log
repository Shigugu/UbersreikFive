The Vermintide Mod Framework (VMF) is an open-source, community-run framework of modules that provides enhanced modding capabilities and support. The framework is designed to be both independent and lightweight; making no changes to gameplay on its own.

Mods created for the project may utilize:
[list]
    [*]Mod options
    [*]Shared function hooks
    [*]Chat commands
    [*]Keybinds
    [*]Mutator support (only available in Vermintide 1 at this time)
    [*]Network calls
    [*]Rewritten, lightweight mod functions
    [*]An on-event call system
[/list]

The Vermintide Mod Framework originally started in Warhammer End Times: Vermintide as an unofficial modding platform. In the time since, VMF has been rewritten and redesigned with contributions from many unique members of the community; culminating in this unified project made for the arrival of official mod support.

If you're interested in creating mods with VMF, please check out [url=https://vmf-docs.verminti.de/]the project's wiki[/url].

If you'd like to contribute to the code behind VMF, visit [url=https://github.com/Vermintide-Mod-Framework/Vermintide-Mod-Framework]the project's GitHub repository[/url]. (string)

14:28:02.907 [Lua]   [description] = A set of various tweaks that empower the fighting capabilities of bots in a fair manner.

The mod currently features 3 modifications :

[b]1 - Better Melee Choices:[/b] The bots will now favor normal attacks over charged much more, unless their target would not be damaged by normal attacks.

[b]2 - Stay Closer:[/b] Whenever enemies are nearby, the bots will stay much closer to human players, making them more reliable during hordes.

[b]3 - Ping Elites:[/b] The bots will ping any elites that attack them, within the same limits of what a player could do. This will trigger appropriate voicelines and Witch-Hunt buffs.

Each of these features can be independantly toggled on and off in the mod options. (string)

Some things that might not be obvious:
[list]
[*] You can right-click on a loadout number to restore that loadout without having to open the loadout details panel.
[*] You can rename a loadout by clicking on its current name at the top of the loadout details panel.
[*] Loadouts are saved to a Steam cloud file, so if you play Vermintide 2 on multiple PCs using the same account, your loadouts should be automatically kept up to date on all of them without having to manually copy files.
[/list]

Version: 1.1.0
Changelist:
1.1.1: Fix for breakage caused by patch 1.5 of the game.

1.0.6: Fix for another exploit which allowed items to be equipped in the wrong slots.
1.0.5: Fix for exploits which allowed items to be equipped on the wrong careers.
1.0.4: Don't rely on deprecated behaviour of hook library (repeatedly hooking same function).
1.0.3: Fix for breakage from changes in v1.2 of the game.
1.0.2: Fixes to work with hero/career switch in UI Improvements mod
1.0.1: Fixes for UI scaling

The successor to Bestiary and Armory, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/itemedittext/?id=1653236575]Vermitannica[/url], has arrived! Soon, all the features found in Armory will be present in Vermitannica.
As such, support for Armory & Bestiary is being discontinued. Download Vermitannica now and offer your feedback!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Updated for 1.4 (Back to Ubersreik)!
- Note: Bardin's Dual Hammers "Light Attack 4" is actually the followup attack after the push attack.
This will be fixed to be more intuitive in a future update.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Armory provides an in-game weapon browser, complete with:

               - Basic weapon attributes;
               - Model & illusion previews;
               - In-depth attack attributes & bonuses (coming soon)

               Open with /armory or set a keybind using the Mod Options menu (F4 by default) (string)
