The Vermintide Mod Framework (VMF) is an open-source, community-run framework of modules that provides enhanced modding capabilities and support. The framework is designed to be both independent and lightweight; making no changes to gameplay on its own.

Mods created for the project may utilize:
[list]
    [*]Mod options
    [*]Shared function hooks
    [*]Chat commands
    [*]Keybinds
    [*]Mutator support (only available in Vermintide 1 at this time)
    [*]Network calls
    [*]Rewritten, lightweight mod functions
    [*]An on-event call system
[/list]

The Vermintide Mod Framework originally started in Warhammer End Times: Vermintide as an unofficial modding platform. In the time since, VMF has been rewritten and redesigned with contributions from many unique members of the community; culminating in this unified project made for the arrival of official mod support.

If you're interested in creating mods with VMF, please check out [url=https://vmf-docs.verminti.de/]the project's wiki[/url].

If you'd like to contribute to the code behind VMF, visit [url=https://github.com/Vermintide-Mod-Framework/Vermintide-Mod-Framework]the project's GitHub repository[/url]. (string)

Some things that might not be obvious:
[list]
[*] You can right-click on a loadout number to restore that loadout without having to open the loadout details panel.
[*] You can rename a loadout by clicking on its current name at the top of the loadout details panel.
[*] Loadouts are saved to a Steam cloud file, so if you play Vermintide 2 on multiple PCs using the same account, your loadouts should be automatically kept up to date on all of them without having to manually copy files.
[/list]

Version: 1.1.0
Changelist:
1.1.1: Fix for breakage caused by patch 1.5 of the game.
1.1.0: Added a few new features: bot override loadouts, right-click loadout number to restore it, and restore loadouts on hero-select screen when joining games.
1.0.6: Fix for another exploit which allowed items to be equipped in the wrong slots.
1.0.5: Fix for exploits which allowed items to be equipped on the wrong careers.
1.0.4: Don't rely on deprecated behaviour of hook library (repeatedly hooking same function).
1.0.3: Fix for breakage from changes in v1.2 of the game.
1.0.2: Fixes to work with hero/career switch in UI Improvements mod
1.0.1: Fixes for UI scaling
1.0.0: Initial release

https://github.com/stevedonovan/Penlight

Docs:
http://stevedonovan.github.io/Penlight/api/index.html

Use:
local pl = require'pl.import_into'()
pl.tablex.deepcompare(t1, t2)

Or to require individual modules:
local tablex = require'pl.tablex'
tablex.deepcompare(t1, t2)

Please DO NOT use require 'pl', this pollutes the global table.

Some modules have been removed due to security concerns: sip and lapp, and those related to file access.
Note that using the pretty module to print tables can cause a stack overflow due to it not handling recursion in table members.

/info is a way to show some text permanently, look in the mod options to customize it.

The option to host private quick play games had to be removed for the mod to get sanctioned.
=======================================================================

Allows you to host a quick play session even if you are playing solo. Other players might still join your lobby.

type [b]/host_toggle[/b] to toggle on and off.

[h1] Update [/h1]
- Added option to use a hotkey to toggle the mod on and off.
- You can now host the weekly challenges with this mod.

[h1] Important [/h1]
As the purpose of the quick play function is to fill open lobbies you will have to actively enable the solo-host-function by typing '/host_toggle' [b] every time you start up [/b] your game (game != lobby).

16:31:02.162 [Lua]   [description] = Small patch to avoid high damage numbers crashing the game.

The RPC that is used to sync damage between players is limited to 255.75 damage per call. And even though Fatshark had an issue with Shade about this exact damage cap once, they didn't implement the fix in a way that would benefit every source of damage.
This mod mimics the behaviour that Fatshark used to fix Shade's issue in order to allow any source to deal more damage by splitting the synchronizing RPC call into smaller chunks that stay within the defined limit.

[h1]For mod users[/h1]
Even if this mod is not listed as an explicit dependency of any of the mods you installed, it may still be a good idea to install it as a safety measure if you use multiple mods that affect weapon damage.

[h1]For mod authors[/h1]
If it is possible that your mod or a combination with other mods increases weapon damage above 255.75, then it is a good idea to put this mod into your dependencies. Examples of such would be increasing the damage amount in hooks to functions like 'DamageUtils.calculate_damage' or 'GenericHealthExtension.add_damage'.

-------------------

Onslaught is a difficulty mod that, as its name would suggest, increases spawn rates of all enemies significantly.

However, this increase is nothing like a 'send in the next wave' or 'vanguard' deed. It features extensive changes to the very compositions of what the AI director throws at you, making hordes capable of throwing a mixture of elites at you, as well as making ambient packs much more threatening.

Furthermore, Onslaught features a redesign of [i]every single event in the game[/i] to make each of them unique challenges, and the highlights of the map.


Use [b]/onslaught[/b] in the chat to toggle the mod. You must be in the keep to do so. [b]Only the host needs the mod, clients may join and play without any prerequesites.[/b]

All the players need this mod to make it work.

This is a project that has been extended from MorePlayers mod but its not been tested by me.
Because its hard to orginize this many players i hope the community will help out and share there result.
This project can easily been extended to 16 players, but i want to have first some feedback before i extend the players.

Chat commands on hero selection:
- /set_profile <profile_id> - Change profile spot

How to use the mod:
- Install the mod and host your game.
- All your friends also need to install the mod. The first 5 players don't need to use any commands to connect to the server. 
- The 6e, 7e, 8e, ... friend need to go the 'hero selection' and type in '/set_profile 6' or '/set_profile 7' or '/set_profile 8' to claim the profile.
After they are switched to a different profile they can connect to your server.

Important:
- Don't enable 'Duplicated Character' mod.
- Don't enable 'MorePlayers' mod.

Extra information:
- Bots are set to 7 because when i was developing and extended to 9 bots the game started the lag really hard.
- When your developing on mods and you want to reload the framework. The game will crash.
This is because this version has a custom network_config file injected in the game and it can't be unload.

Last note:
Please post your console log when you crash:
C:\Users\IamLupo\AppData\Roaming\Fatshark\Vermintide 2\console_logs
And save it on here: https://pastebin.com/

All the players need this mod to make it work.

Chat commands on hero selection:
- /set_profile <profile_id> - Change profile spot

How to use the mod:
- Install the mod and host your game.
- All your friends also need to install the mod. The first 5 players don't need to use any commands to connect to the server. 
- The 6e, 7e and 8e friend need to go the 'hero selection' and type in '/set_profile 6' or '/set_profile 7' or '/set_profile 8' to claim the profile.
After they are switched to a different profile they can connect to your server.

Options:
- When using this mod you can still join servers that doesn't have this mod installed.

Important:
- Don't enable 'Duplicated Character' mod. This project is outdated and has been migrated in MorePlayers mod.

Now, your opponents actually possess a will to live, and all wish for your death.

If you truly believe yourself a legend, you will crush their dreams.[/i]

-------

Deathwish is a mod that empowers all enemies way past the pitiful strength they have on legend, while making sure the challenge remains enjoyable. Skaven will regain the resilience they once possessed in the first Vermintide, and the northlanders will show their true strength.

This mod is based around and replaces legend difficulty when enabled, but one can also select champion instead to experience it with less intense spawn rates (but just as strong enemies).

The full list of all changes made compared to vanilla legend would be too much clutter to include, but here's a shortened version :

* Increased health of all common infantry by ~125%.
* Increased health of all elites and specials by ~80%.
* Increased health of bosses by 50%.
* Increased mass and stagger resistance of all enemies by ~100%. Further increased the mass and stagger resistance of slave rats and fanatics to bring them closer to (but still below) that of clan rats.
* Increased the damage of common infantry by ~25-33%.
* Increased the damage of elites, specials and bosses by ~50%.

While these changes might seem very heavy-handed at first sight, that is because this shortened list does not do them justice. All the values modified were modified by hand, one at a time, with thought put into making health breakpoints fair and enjoyable yet challenging, while also staying true to the design and feel of the vanilla game.

Use [b]/deathwish[/b] in the chat to toggle. Must be hosting and in the keep. Due to an issue found with mass, clients [b]do[/b] need to be subscribed for everything to work as expected. They however do not need to do anything beyond subscribing and enabling the mod in the mod manager. (string)
